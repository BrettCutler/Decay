Robocay Task Notes
======================

Voxel
--------------
* finish tutorial
* modify y-size to .33, or .25
    * places to add scalar:
        * World.cs
            * CreateChunk at position, pos.y needs to be scaled when Instantiating
        * WorldPos.cs
            * I don't think this refers to *literal* position, just index position
        * Block.cs
            * FaceData[North/South/etc]() generates vertices; scale y
            *
        * Terrain.cs
            * GetBlockPos( Vector3 pos ):
                Grabs WorldPos directly from Vector3 which is rounded
                * So here we need an extra conversion
                    * And clarify names: WorldPos is either truly position in WorldSpace (rename: WorldSpacePos) or is block index across entire world (rename: WorldBlockIndexPos)

* Wrap all voxel classes in a namespace
