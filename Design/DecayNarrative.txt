Decay Story
---------------------
[why does the human village have so little agency? How can we avoid infantilizing them?]
- they are refugees
- they have just moved into this area
- they are responsible for waking you up, investigating
- the land is too polluted so only you can safely dredge it


[computer advisors named after candide characters?]
[or, Gulliver's Travels characters[!]]
- Gulliver's Travels gives away that they're worthless from the beginning
    - but what we want is that they discover their thinking is limited

[scene: player is leading human into home robo-base]
[computers discourage this, and in fact begin telling obvious lies to stop it]

CHARACTER
-little girl-
- appears early (first village visit?)
    - as a child, growth after first time break will hammer home how world changes
    - 'bicentennial man'-esque story (or that's just, CAN A ROBOT LOVE A MAN?)
        - nope, scratch that, its a turrible idea
[scene: player makes friends with little girl]
lg: "..."
lg: "oh!"
lg: "hi! I haven't seen you before."
lg: "I'm Anne. Who are you?"
player: "..."
lg: "oh. Well, ...it's pretty cool to have a robot friend. "
