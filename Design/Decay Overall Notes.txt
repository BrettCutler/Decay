Decay Overall Notes
====================
** JUST BECAUSE IT'S SIMULATED DOESN'T MAKE IT INTERESTING!! ***
** WITHOUT PLAYER AGENCY & UNDERSTANDING, CHANGE IS MEANINGLESS **


Prototype Requirements
-----------------------
- Simple 'maintenance' loop
	- 3-5 'tasks' player can undertake
		- destroy trees
		- destroy rocks
		- place road
		- place fence
		- till field
		- plant seeds?
		- fight
	- player has energy gauge
	- town with 3-10 NPCs
		- dialogue system
	- opening outside of town
	- probably don't need random generation




'zoning' vs hand-placing
	- how much work do the townspeople do?
	- in prototype, this can be automatic
	 

Touchstones
---------------
- Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter
    - oppressive mood from visible cost to each action
        - even walking!
    - totality of misery of situation without dry depths
- Harvest Moon / Stardew Valley
- Don't Starve
- Chrono Trigger
    - conception of Robo working for 1,000 years. In the blink of an eye, you meet him in the future...but now he's the elder
- Souls
    - multiple routes to go and exploration is constrained by difficulty
        - except we're using player's energy efficiency and buildout of each route plus a little combat...!

Visuals
----------
- import mupen-psx's fullscreen dither effect
- rolling fog like Silent Hill
- CRT shader I'm using in MAME
- pixel-art textures
- orange, green glows from computer terminals
- swamp, dirt
- color palette: based on SNES post-apocalypse
- character design: trash can with tank treads
	- Wall-E treads
	- Robo (Chrono Trigger) chassis
	- what kind of arms?
- PSX-style square pixel font, in additive transparency
- Play with reflections in low res
    - even just some color matching would be nice


UI
-----------------
- tile inspect function
    - get a text description of each layer on the tile
	   - ex: "Cabbage: a crop is growing. It will mature in 7 days and provide 5,000 kilocalories.
		Tilled field: this ground is tilled and will support planted crops. The humans will automatically plant this field and nurture the crops.
		""
    - should this draw in corner along with decorative text?
        - top-right
        - flight games as example (Ace Combat 2)

- villager text must look different from UI elements
    - UI is ROBOT THOUGHTS, villager speech is human contact
    - so, different font
        - serif font?
        - PSX's serif font: Silent Hill text (or general Survival Horror-style text)
        - pixellated? or not, but noisy somehow
    - without border? just text on bottom of screen, simple and basic

- indicator that villagers have something new to say
    - ellipses above head

- 

Biome simulation
-----------------
- land types:
	- grassland
		- grass
		- flowers
	- forest, deciduous
		- deciduous tree
		- fern
	- forest, pine
		- pine tree
		- fern
	- swamp
		- mangrove tree
		- lily
		- NEEDS: water
	- barren
		- rocks
		- trash to dig through?
		- NEEDS: dig below topsoil
			- can this be repaired back to support life?
				- sure, dump topsoil on top
	- computerized
		- cables
		- terminals
		- NEEDS: power

Craftables
--------------
- land-shaping buildings
	- fence
		- prevent natural growth from crossing its borders
- workshops
	- ethanol generator
		- dump biomatter in hopper to produce electricity
	- solar generator
		- craft using mineral resources (sink)
		- breaks after next long sleep?
	- recharge station
	- power lines
		- string into generator from power source
		- fat (arm-thick) cables that lay across ground
			- ugh, need junction system to coexist with other art
- transport
    - conveyor & train tracks
        - Minecraft, Dig 'N Rig, Factorio as touchstones
        - seperate for player transport and resource transport?
            - maybe separate cars, but same transport
            - OR player can automatically hook treads to track and move at x3 speed

Using 3D space
----------------
- water level simulation
	- allows:
		- drain swamp
		- dam rivers
		- flood
	- as Minecraft, tile-based
		- does Minecraft generate water by volume per source, or 'up to height' from source?
		- so, do I make rivers from 'river spwan' spots with a limited water volume production?
		- think  about this in real life: water is prodced yearly from mountains, then dispersed gradually
			- so we're talking flow rate, not a cap
			- so, if we simulate that, we have to model the water draining into (ocean?) eventually
			- though, it'd be neat to let player flood themselves!

Rest/Reset points
------------------
* On battery:
	- battery is equivalent to Harvest Moon's stamina bar.
		When it expires, you do to
	- MAIN break is a period of years
		- humans age up
		- environment runs its simulation *many* cycles
			- trees grow
			- fences break down
			- wars between human tribes?
			- forests encroach/retreat
			- do humans finish projects the robot started?
			- human buildings go up/down
				- need a simulation of economic value/decay?


	- battery gets recharged

- daily reset vs. long-term analogous to Harver Moon's months?
- or, is it daily activities vs monthly events in Persona?
	- as in, you can put off doing some tasks but really ought finish them before your reset point


- how much of infrastructure breaks after long sleep?
	- for example, solar panels automatically produce energy, but break after sleep.
		- So player has to rebuild solar panel infrastructure each time
		- so it's a tradeoff between investing the time/energy to build it and  reaping the benefits

- probably need an external force to eventually force sleep
	- otherwise, once players become self-sustaining, no more resets
	- so: environmental factor?
		- wild seasons create 'long dark', no sunlight to recharge?
		- earth shakes, volcanic eruptions release plume
			- symptomatic and suggestive of deeper trauma within the earth...
				- is this a long-term player goal?
		- ocean rises in seasonal storms
			- provides opportunity to stand on cliff overlooking ocean and discuss...

- player is gathering resources to extend 'active days' while playing before long-term shutdown
	- so, as in a survival game (Don't Starve), there's a 'stabilization point' player is building towards
		- stabilization and nothing else is achievable, but then player puts it out of reach again when they set higher goals: building up town, delving deeper

- what if real time has to pass on long-term shutdown before player can play again?
	- to literalize 'remote' connection to robot
	- to make time passage *felt*


Dungeoneering
-------------------
- venture into submerged ruins to uncover past, lost tech

- treasures
	- blueprints
		- maybe a useful limiting factor on players advancing too early, and a good reward
			- counter: reduces visibility into reward system
				- well, player can download 'potential' plans seperately from earning right to build them
	- personal upgrades
		- do these persist?
			- Yes: players need the sense of accomplishment and reward in a world otherwise so dark
				- look at player chafing to item break systems in System Shock 2, Final Fantasy Legend (SaGa)

- enemies
    - enemy design *must* speak to history of world
        - bio-mutants and crazee robots are traditonal, and nice 'n nutritious in this setting, but...
            - a bit cliche, boring
        - what were people striving towards when it collapsed? What were their hopes, fears?
            - ex: Fallout mutants: can we engineer ourselves past our mistakes? Science past so we don't have to reckon with errors
            - Searchers: creatures, machines built to search for answer 
    - is it guarded, or overrun?
        - guarded == intelligence to protect secrets
            - governments' natural tendency towards secrecy and unthinking strength
        - overrun -> speaks to decay in world, speaks to what has happened since
            - bot searches for tech and materials

- computer terminals
    - recorded for later in UI
    - trigger new dungeons
    - trigger world-shaping changes
        - open doors
            - open a door in the ground, creating a cavern in the settlement
                - a shortcut, but in the process it destroys your valuable work, or even settlers' lives
        - re-activate useful machinery
            - charging stations
            - field tools
                - pumps for water
                - dams
                - conveyors


- visual design
    - cluttered verticality like Vagrant story
        - boxes, ladders, transportation, obvious light sources
            - room based?
                - maybe variable-sized rooms, like Link to the Past's overworld

- options done with physical dipswitches
    - as Galak-Z plan for real-world photo living room,
        - game options occur in 'real world' with monitor displaying game world
    - how obvious should this barrier be when game starts?
        - probably not right away, but introduce when we need because it creates a mystery layer


Beginning
--------------------
- wake up, short textual coontext
	- explore nearby terminals for more
- navigate through nearby empty environment
- immediate goal: collect resources to build batteries/recharge power collectors
- go through multiple failure cycles?
	- as in, by the time player finds village they realize they've been starving for some time
		- they might mention how many years ago they noticed/created the event that woke you

- large rock? or some other non-human-fixable obstruction is cleared, and the player discovers the town

Narrative
--------------
GOAL: show passage of time from immortal perspective

- our take comprises 3 parts:
    - a handful of strongly-sketched individual storylines
    - simulation tracing tribal/civilizational story
    - history & lore of world

3 Faces
--------------
Computers in place of birth have twisted to form personalities and 'faces'
    - columns of wires, cables able to be anthropomorphically interpreted
    - offer conflicting advice and opinions based on personality
    - give obfuscated clues to nature of setting
        - they themselves don't know, of course, so observations are colored by their personalities
    - contrast behavior and attitudes with humans
        - "humans are a process"
            - fulfilling a purporse
            - [computer expresses most reductive, big-picture view of people]
        - "humans are unpredictable"
            - [other computer expresses unfathomable individual human complexity]
